This is a response to Edward Z. Yang's [Extremist Programming](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/11/extremist-programming/) article.

What Edward calls "Extremist Programming", I call "practice".

A while back I participated in a [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org) run by [Corey Haines](http://coreyhaines.com). The idea of a Code Retreat is that you write the solution to the same problem half a dozen times during the course of a day, and you throw out your code each time.

It took a while for the point of this to sink in, and it was a couple of things that Corey said that finally made it click.


## Perfect Practice Makes Perfect

I think Corey attributed this to his violin teacher, but it seems to originate from [Vince Lombardi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi):

"Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect."

If you want to get better at something, don't just do it the way you'd normally do it. Slow it down, try a different approach, be more attentive and thoughtful. Try to do it the ideal way (for some definition of ideal.)

I've been learning guitar for the last year, and a big part of that has been learning how to practice. Practicing well is a skill in itself, and it takes time to learn that skill.

If I'm playing something badly, and all I do in practice is play it badly over and over again, I don't get any better. What I have to do is get out the metronome, slow it down, try different techniques for parts I'm struggling with, get them right, then slowly build up the speed again. And I have to pay attention to what I'm doing, not rush, and not fall back into habitual mistakes.

The same goes for practicing programming. If you want to get better, don't just do the same thing you do in your day job. Slow it down, try different techniques, think about what you're doing, repeat the same thing over but in different ways, with different techniques and constraints.


## No Extremism Required

I think it's telling that the idea of deliberate practice is so alien to most developers that Edward Z. Yang feels it is "extremist". Computing is a very young discipline. We still haven't figured out how to build software well, which means that even the very best developers still have a lot to learn. Nobody is above practice.
