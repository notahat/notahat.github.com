<p><a href="https://twitter.com/donttrythis">Adam Savage</a> is one of my
heroes. He recently gave this great talk at <a
href="http://boingboing.net/tag/ingenuity">Boing Boing: Ingenuity</a>.</p>

<p>Because I haven't found them anywhere else, here are Adam's rules written
out:</p>

<dl class="ground-rules">
  <dt>1. Get good at something</dt>
  <dd>Really good. Get good at as many things as you can. Being good at one
  thing makes it easier to get good at other things.</dd>

  <dt>2. Getting good at stuff takes practice</dt>
  <dd>Lots and lots of practice.</dd>

  <dt>3. Get OBSESSED</dt>
  <dd>Everyone at the top of their field is obsessed with what they're doing.</dd>

  <dt>4. Doing something well and thoroughly is it's OWN reward</dt>

  <dt>5. Show and tell</dt>
  <dd>If you do something well and you're happy with it, for Flying Spaghetti
  Monster's sake, tell EVERYONE.</dd>

  <dt>6. If you want something, ask</dt>
  <dd>If something piques your interest, tell someone. If you want to learn
  something, ask someone, like your BOSS. As an employer I can tell you, people
  who want to learn new skills are people I want to keep employed.</dd>

  <dt>7. Have GOALS</dt>
  <dd>Make up goals. Set goals. Regularly assess where you are and where you
  want to be in terms of them. This is a kind of prayer that works, and works
  well. Allow for the fact that things will NEVER turn out like you think they
  will, and you must be prepared to end up miles from where you intended.</dd>

  <dt>8. Be nice</dt>
  <dd>TO EVERYONE. Life is way to short to be an asshole. If you are an
  asshole, apologise.</dd>

  <dt>9. Fail</dt>
  <dd>You will fail. It's one of our jobs in life. Keep failing. When you fail,
  admit it. When you don't, don't get cocky, because you're just about to fail
  again.</dd>

  <dt>10. Work your ass off</dt>
  <dd>Work like your life depends on it.</dd>
</dl>
