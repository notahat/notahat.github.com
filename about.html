<h1>Hello, I'm Pete Yandell</h1>

<p>I write software for <a href="http://envato.com/">Envato</a>.</p>

<p>Before Envato, I co-founded <a href="http://www.redtxt.com.au/">RedTxt</a>.</p>

<p>I helped start Melbourne's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/connected-community-hackerspace">Connected Community HackerSpace</a>.</p>

<p>I catch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notahat/sets/72157619343361979/">penguins</a> for <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~earthcar/">Earthcare St Kilda</a> as part of their their long-term survey of the St Kilda penguin colony (and I often have the bite marks to prove it.)</p>

<p>For a while I organised the <a href="http://ruby.org.au/meetups/mel.html">Melbourne Ruby User Group</a>, but now I just turn up to the odd meeting.</p>
