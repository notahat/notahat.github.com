<p><strong>SimpleSynth is a small and fast synth</strong>, perfect for when you
want to try out a musical idea quickly.  It's got a complete general MIDI
instrument set built in, and it can load Soundfonts and DLS files.</p>

<p>Be warned though: I haven't updated it in a long time, so your mileage may
vary under Lion and later. If you'd like to contribute fixes, you can find the
<a href="https://github.com/notahat/simplesynth">source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
